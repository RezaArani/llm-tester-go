# LLM Benchmarking & Latency Testing Tool (Go)

üöÄ A Golang-based tool for benchmarking LLM (Large Language Model) response times, measuring embedding performance, analyzing latency, and evaluating contextual reasoning accuracy.

## üõ† Features
- **Multi-Model Support**: Runs benchmarks on various LLM models (e.g., StableLM2, LLaMA 3.1 70B Instruct).
- **Latency & Performance Testing**:
  - Measures **embedding time**, **response time**, and **first-byte latency**.
  - Provides a **structured table report** of all evaluations.
- **Cosine Similarity Check**: Uses **BGE-Base-en V1.5** to compare vector embeddings.
- **Contextual Reasoning Check**: Utilizes **LLaMA 3.1 70B Instruct** to assess reasoning capabilities.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Evaluation**: Supports document retrieval analysis.
- **Streaming Response Handling**: Captures real-time responses for precise benchmarking.

## üì• Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RezaArani/llm-tester-go
   cd llm-tester-go
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Run the tool**:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```
** To run this tool, you need Redis and Ollama. Installation instructions for both can be found online.

## üîß Configuration
Modify the `models` array in `main.go` to specify which models you want to test:
```go
 

	models := []string{
		"stablelm2",
		"llama3.2:1b",
		"llama3.1",
		"deepseek-r1:1.5b",
		"tinyllama",
		"llama3.2",
		"stablelm2",
		"aya",
		"granite3-dense:8b",
		"mistral",
		"wizardlm2",
		"qwen2",

		
	}

 
	queries := []string{
		"What is SemMapas? (limiting it to a maximum of 50 words)", // limit text for testing token count
		"Sum of SemMapas annual costs?",                            // me may keep model decide the result
		// "Say Hi",
	}

Sum of SemMapas annual costs?

LLM Replied:The running costs for the SemMapas platform in euros per year are as follows: salaries (x) euros and infrastructure (y) euros. To find the total annual cost, we add x + y together.

In this case, since no specific values were provided for x or y, I will make up some numbers to demonstrate:

Let's say:
- Salaries = 1000 euros
- Infrastructure = 800 euros

Now, let's calculate the total annual cost:
Total Annual Cost = 1000 (salaries) + 800 (infrastructure) = 1800 euros

So, the sum of SemMapas annual costs is 1800 euros.

Contextual Reasoning Check(Is it correct?):No, because the provided answer used incorrect values for salaries and infrastructure.
